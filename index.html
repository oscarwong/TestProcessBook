							<p>This process book details and guides through our group's design process. Our assignment was to identify a problem that was prevalent among college students and to design a solution for it. After many thorough interviews and dialogues with colleagues, we discovered that our classmates were very busy and had multiple obligations to juggle everyday. Because of this, students had disrupted eating schedules and established unhealthy eating habits. We decided to tackle this issue and find a solution that would be compatible with our users.</p>
							<p>This website is dedicated towards summarizing the different stages that took place during the project. This includes, but is not exclusive to, our team dynamics, responsibilities, and goals.</p>

							<p>Prior to meeting with our group we were required to fill out a skills survey, which outlined who we would be matched up with. I marked my expertise in graphic design. When teams were finally formed, we were set on the first task of finding ways in which the iSchool could advertise itself much better. Our group was able to explore beyond the classroom to find inspiration and ideas. This exercise not only allowed us to practice brainstorming ideas, it also allowed us to discover the importance of immersing yourself into the environment and truly obtain a different perspective.</p>

							<p>Later on in the course, we were given the task to identify a problem that concerned a majority of college students. With that in mind, we began brainstorming and producing many ideas. We eventually came up with the problem of <strong>Eating healthy on a budget</strong> in which we strongly believed that was a substantial problem among college students.</p>

							<p>Upon doing further interviews with classmates, we soon discovered that eating healthy was an important consideration on college student’s minds, but it was not something they would actively work towards in their current situation. The main factor that has been hindering our colleagues from eating healthier is time. </p>

							<p>We then changed our direction in the problem space to include enhanced time management. We were all very reluctant to change paths and thus it was difficult to incorporate this new concept, but we eventually gave in and changed our problem statement to <strong>Eating healthy on a time and monetary budget</strong>.</p>

							<p>To capture as many ideas as possible, we wrote down possible solutions to our problems on sticky notes. This allowed us to organize our ideas into different categories—such as phone apps, solutions involving the UW administration, movements, and answers requiring the user to resolve their issue. In addition to collaboratively brainstorm these ideas, we were required to compose 40 ideas of our own to bring together and discuss.</p>

							<p>Once we assembled together, we were able to converge our individual 40 ideas together. From this compilation, three solutions were agreed upon and made into paper prototypes.</p>

							<p>The three ideas we chose to follow through with were the <strong>Scheduling App</strong>, <strong>Pet Feeding App</strong>, and the <strong>HFS Pre-Order App</strong>—all three pictured to the left. The scheduling app, thought of by me, allowed users to input their schedule and composed a series of different eating schedules around their input. During the prototyping, the app proved to be ineffective, as our testers believed that they would hardly use the app. The app itself was very similar to the existing calendar app on the iPhone, so many users felt comfortable with the familiar UI.</p>

							<p>The pet feeding app, thought of by Hillary, had some mixed results. The purpose of the app was to take care of a virtual pet and feed it food that the user ate during the day. The pet would then react to each feeding—negatively or positively—depending on the type of food it received. For some testers, the intention of the app was unclear and they saw no purpose in using it. Although it was well received by the whole team and thought it was going to be a success, we ultimately rejected the prototype and chose the pre-ordering app.</p>

							<p>The pre-ordering app, created by Christina, had a relatively positive response. It was straightforward and easy to use, as when ordering the food is a linear process. When deciding which app to move on with, it was between the pet feeding app and pre-ordering app. As stated previously, we moved on with the pre-ordering app since it was much more useful and addressed both issues of time management and healthy eating.</p>

							<p>When initially composing the app, we used PowerPoint slides to test it out with different users. Through testing we identified many large issues with our app. This included when setting a favorite order at the end of an order, the UI immediately directed the user to place the order instead of confirming with the user whether they wanted to set the order as a favorite and then have the option to place the order. </p>

							<p>In addition to UI problems, the aesthetics of the prototype app was not optimal at all. The colors were clashing and the text was not too suitable for the prototype, as it was a bit too small. This led me to redesign the entire app. The screen capture on the right shows the midst of designing an order confirmation screen. I was also in charge of producing the video for our prototype. I made a rough draft video of a screen slide displaying a few of the application’s screens, which can be watched on the right as well.</p>

							<p>A difficulty of mine during the design process was trying not to perfect everything at each stage. As a perfectionist, I am extremely detail oriented and I strive to create the most optimal compositions. It was hard for me to let go of that perfectionist mindset and step into a world in which it was alright to have unpolished prototypes, as it would allow me to explore what could be improved in a design.</p>

							<p>I am glad to have been placed in such a well-balanced team. We were able to effectively communicate ideas to one another and freely give each other critiques. Working in such a team allowed me to stretch my mind beyond the perfectionist bubble and take risks that I thought I would have never in the past.</p>
